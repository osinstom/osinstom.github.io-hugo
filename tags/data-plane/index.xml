      <description>Recently, I work on a performance comparison between virtualization technologies. In order to made an experiment I had had to setup a test environment based on OVS-DPDK and KVM-based Virtual Machine. This user guide shows how to install and configure the test scenario with OVS-DPDK and libvirt. The test scenario is presented below. According to OVS flow rules configuration we can test PHY-OVS-PHY scenario (green line) or PHY-VM-PHY scenario (red line).</description>

      <description>In the previous post I introduced P4 and tools to implement network prototypes. Now, I would like to show a basic example how to use this tools in practice to run an experiment.
I prepared a demo of IP routing to show how simply someone can prototype a commonly used technology. The demo is based on P4 and Mininet. The source code and user guide is available at https://github.com/osinstom/p4-demos/tree/master/ip-routing.
The README file contains a description of a P4 program&amp;rsquo;s design as well as a topology of a test network.</description>
