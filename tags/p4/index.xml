      <description>Introduction Recently, I started to implement the support for packet tunneling in our P4C-to-uBPF compiler. However, in order to deeply understand P4 constructs describing tunneling I have created the reference implementation of the VXLAN tunneling for BMv2 switch.
This blog post describes how to design and implement more complex tunneling technique (like VXLAN) in the P4 language. The source code is available on Github.
Short introduction to VXLAN The VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) protocol has been standardized in RFC 7348 and is usually used to provide overlay communications between virtual machines in the multi-tenant virtualized data center.</description>

      <title>IP Router in P4</title>

      <description>In the previous post I introduced P4 and tools to implement network prototypes. Now, I would like to show a basic example how to use this tools in practice to run an experiment.
I prepared a demo of IP routing to show how simply someone can prototype a commonly used technology. The demo is based on P4 and Mininet. The source code and user guide is available at https://github.com/osinstom/p4-demos/tree/master/ip-routing.
The README file contains a description of a P4 program&amp;rsquo;s design as well as a topology of a test network.</description>
